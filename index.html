        <p>"Maleficent" is a 2014 fantasy film that offers a fresh perspective on the classic fairy tale of "Sleeping
          Beauty." The movie explores the untold backstory of the iconic Disney villain, Maleficent, portrayed by
          Angelina Jolie. It delves into her transformation from a kind-hearted fairy living in the magical Moors to a
          vengeful sorceress after a betrayal. Maleficent places a curse on Princess Aurora, the king's daughter, which
          leads to the familiar tale of the sleeping beauty. However, as the story unfolds, it reveals themes of
          redemption, forgiveness, and the complexity of human nature. The film provides a unique twist on the
          traditional fairy tale, emphasizing the idea that "evil" characters may have more depth and humanity than
          initially perceived.</p>
